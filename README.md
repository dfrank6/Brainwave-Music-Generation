# Brain-Wave-Music-Generation

This is an art/science fusion project at Georgia Tech from November 2021 to present. We are using the [Muse](https://choosemuse.com/) brain computer interface to convert brainwaves into music in multi-modal performances. As part of this project, I have collaborated now or in the past with with the following people:

[Dr. Francesco Fedele](https://ce.gatech.edu/directory/person/francesco-fedele) - Georgia Tech Professor

[Dr. Mike Winters](https://mikewinters.io/) - Music Technologist

[Rachel Grant](https://www.rachelgrantstudio.com/) - Painter

[Bella Dorado](https://www.facebook.com/belladoradodance/) - Dancer

[Tanisha Chanda](https://tanishachanda.wixsite.com/portfolio/bio) - Georgia Tech Neuroscience Student and Painter

[Alex Jenkins](https://alexj.io/) - Georgia Tech Computer Engineering Student 


My role has been primarily to convert the live brainwave data into music. I do this by connecting each brainwave to an appropriate element of the music according to its function (i.e. low frequency prominent during sleeping might equal bass, high frequency prominent during problem solving might equal melody). I code this with [SuperCollider](https://supercollider.github.io/). Brainwaves are sent over local network to my computer, processed, and then sent to Ableton to generate the music.

There are two samples of the code here:
- med
  - Soothing, meditation like song. The intensity of the music depends on the amplitude of the brainwaves of a single person wearing a Muse.
- Song 2
  - Slow paced melodic song. The intensity of the music depends on the harmony of the brainwaves of two people who are each wearing a Muse in this case. If they are in perfect harmony, the song will be silent.

You can hear a sample of the music in **med_sample.mp3** and also check out some performances here:
